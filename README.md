# Search Aid Chrome Extension

Pre-populates search boxes on websites so you don't have to re-type your search term over and over again.

For example, Search Aid captures the last search term used on Amazon.com, so when you visit Ebay.com your term is pre-populated on the search box. The captured search term expires after a few minutes, after which it is no longer used.

To support more websites change [site_handlers.js](logic/site_handlers.js) and add to the 'list' array.
